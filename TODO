secure authentication with nestjs(fastify) and mongodb database,
       - use grpc(protobuf && http2) protocol to send data between microservices.

1.multi-factor authentication (mfa) with google authenticator
       - set up google authenticator:
       - install the `speakeasy` package to generate mfa codes.
       - use the `qrcode` package to generate a qr code for google authenticator.
       - create an api endpoint to verify the mfa code after initial username/email/password verification.

2. account management CRUD

       - Create Account;
       - Register Account;
       - Update Account Information;
       - Delete Account;
       - Create Admin Account;
       - Secure Admin Creation Process;
       -verify Account by sending code to email;

3..jwt-based authentication
       - set up jwt:
       - install `@nestjs/jwt` and `jsonwebtoken` for handling jwt tokens.
       - create a login api that generates a jwt after successful user authentication.
       - protect routes using `authguard` to validate jwt tokens on every request.
       - add expiration time and refresh token support for additional security.


4. ssl/tls encryption
       - set up ssl/tls:
       - obtain ssl certificates from a trusted certificate authority (ca).
       - configure https in nestjs by setting up `httpsoptions` in the `nestfactory.create` method.
       - force https for all incoming connections using middleware.

5. API Gateway for Microservices Authentication
       - API Gateway Integration:
       - Use NestJS with @nestjs/microservices to set up an API Gateway.;
       - Implement centralized authentication and token validation in the API Gateway before routing requests to microservices.;
       - Ensure that the API Gateway handles user roles and permissions.;
       - Configure gRPC (Protobuf & HTTP/2) to send data between microservices.;

6. session management
       - implement session management:
       - use `express-session` or `@nestjs/session` to manage user sessions.
       - store session data in mongodb or redis with session expiration handling.
       - add secure, httponly, and samesite flags to session cookies for protection.

7. oauth 2.0 authorization
       - integrate oauth 2.0:
       - install `passport` and `@nestjs/passport` for oauth authentication.
       - use oauth providers like google, facebook, or github for user login.
       - store oauth tokens securely and ensure that token refresh mechanisms are in place.

8. account lockout mechanism
       - implement account lockout:
       - track failed login attempts using a counter stored in mongodb.
       - lock the account after a certain number of failed attempts for a specific time period.
       - implement a reset mechanism or captcha verification after lockout.

9. attribute-based access control (abac)
    - implement abac for fine-grained control:
    - define user attributes (role, location, department, etc.) in mongodb.
    - set up policies based on attributes to control access to routes and resources.
    - create middleware to check attributes before granting access to sensitive endpoints.


10. Gateway between clients and microservices using nginx and grphql
    - implement a gateway to connect clients and microservices using nginx and graphql.
    - use graphql to send data between clients and microservices.
    - use graphql subscriptions to receive updates from microservices.
